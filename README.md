## Basic chat app

This basic chat applications makes it possible for users to chat in a room
together. The basic functionalities of this app are:

-  Users can chat with each other in a chat room.
-  Users can enter a chatroom with a display name.
-  Display name of user when a message is sent.
-  Timestamp when the message is sent.
-  `{user}` is typing functionality.
-  Show users that joined the chatroom in a sidebar.

More functionalities will be added to the application when the basic
functionalities are implemented and working. Eventual ideas would be to
implement some kind of simple game to make interaction between users more fun.
